# Math Utils #

The Math Utils package provides simple math utility functions related to vectors and quaternions. It is designed to be a 
small mininalistic package for convenient operations that I commonly use in game development.

## Quickstart ##
Simply clone this package as a git submodule or download the package as zip from Github and extract it into your project.
